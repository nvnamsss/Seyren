# ðŸŽ® Gameplay Design Baseline (Universal Framework)

## 1. Core Loop
**What the player does repeatedly**

- Define the primary player activities (e.g., explore â†’ fight â†’ loot â†’ upgrade)
- Ensure it is fun on its own, even when repeated
- Make it tight, rewarding, and engaging

> **Example:** In an action RPG â†’ Explore â†’ Fight Enemies â†’ Gain XP â†’ Upgrade Skills â†’ Explore further

---

## 2. Player Goal
**What motivates the player in this level or session**

- Short-term goals: Open door, survive wave, find item
- Long-term goals: Save the world, complete storyline, reach rank X
- Bonus goals: Discover secrets, optional challenges

> Good gameplay always drives players toward something they want to do.

---

## 3. Rules and Boundaries
**What players can and cannot do**

- Define abilities (run, jump, build, cast spells)
- Define limits (canâ€™t pass locked door, stamina drains)
- Set constraints that create meaningful decisions

> Rules turn raw mechanics into actual gameplay.

---

## 4. Feedback System
**How the game responds to actions**

- Visual, audio, and haptic feedback
- UI/UX cues: damage flash, XP popup, sound effects
- World reactions: enemy alertness, environment changes

> Feedback reinforces learning and makes the game world feel alive.

---

## 5. Challenge and Progression
**What pushes the player and how they grow**

- Introduce escalating challenges (new enemies, time limits, puzzles)
- Gradually increase difficulty to maintain tension
- Offer rewards and growth: abilities, tools, narrative, access

> Players enjoy overcoming something.

---

## 6. Choice and Consequence
**Let the player make decisions that matter**

- Strategic choices: What to upgrade, whom to ally with
- Tactical choices: Fight or flee, stealth or attack
- Environmental or narrative consequences: Save or sacrifice

> Good gameplay isnâ€™t just actionâ€”itâ€™s agency.

---

## 7. Pacing and Flow
**Balance of intensity, rest, and rhythm**

- Alternate between tension and relief
- Use layout, music, and encounters to create emotional flow
- Avoid fatigue: mix combat, exploration, and story

> Flow = players are fully engaged without being overwhelmed.

---

## 8. Meaningful Rewards
**Why the player keeps playing**

- Progression: XP, gear, access
- Story: Reveals, twists, world-building
- Cosmetic: Skins, styles, achievements
- Utility: Unlocks tools or skills that change how the game is played

> Reward reinforces behavior and deepens investment.

---

## 9. Immersion & Consistency
**The world must make sense and feel believable**

- Mechanics should match the narrative and setting
- Avoid breaking immersion with inconsistent rules or abrupt tone shifts

> Even abstract games benefit from a strong theme or internal logic.

---

## 10. Fail State and Recovery
**What happens when the player fails**

- What constitutes failure? (death, loss of objective, missed event)
- Is there recovery? (restart, checkpoint, retry)
- Does failure teach the player something?

> Failure should be a learning opportunity, not punishment.

## Class diagram

_This class diagram illustrates a modular gameplay architecture using the Pipeline (Core Loop), Command, and Observer patterns. The `GameCoreLoop` manages a sequence of `IGameStep` objects, each operating on a shared `GameContext`. Systems (Input, AI, Physics, Combat, etc.) are implemented as steps. Entities (Player, Enemy, Puzzle) interact via the context, enabling flexible, decoupled systems._

```mermaid

    class GameCoreLoop {
        +Run(ctx: GameContext)
        -steps: List~IGameStep~
    }
    class IGameStep {
        <<interface>>
        +Execute(ctx: GameContext)
    }
    class GameContext {

## Gameplay Loop (Core Loop)
_Gameplay loop or Core Loop is the heartbeat of gameplayâ€”a short, repeatable cycle of player actions that keeps them engaged and progressing. It defines what the player does over and over in a satisfying way._

### Example

#### RPG Core Loop

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Explore] --> B[Fight Enemies]
    B --> C[Get Loot/XP]
    C --> D[Upgrade Gear/Skills]
    D --> A
```

#### Survival Game Core Loop

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Gather Resources] --> B[Craft Tools/Shelter]
    B --> C[Survive Hazards]
    C --> D[Unlock Better Tools]
    D --> A
```

#### Puzzle Game Core Loop

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Observe] --> B[Attempt Solution]
    B --> C[Get Feedback]
    C --> D[Learn/Retry]
    D --> E[Advance to New Puzzle]
    E --> A
```

## Design Pattern
---

### Pipeline Pattern  
_Also known as Chain of Responsibility or Middleware Style_

- **Model your core loop as a chain of steps**, each responsible for a specific task.
- Each step processes the game state and passes it to the next.
- **Easily insert, remove, or reorder steps** for flexibility.
- Encourages reusable, modular logic.

```go
type CoreStep interface {
    Execute(ctx *GameContext) error
}

type CoreLoop struct {
    steps []CoreStep
}

func (cl *CoreLoop) Run(ctx *GameContext) {
    for _, step := range cl.steps {
        step.Execute(ctx)
    }
}
```

**Example Loop Pipeline Structure:**

```go
coreLoop := CoreLoop{
    steps: []CoreStep{
        ReadInputStep{},
        ExecuteCommandsStep{},
        AIUpdateStep{},
        PhysicsStep{},
        CollisionStep{},
        CombatStep{},
        LootStep{},
        ApplyEventsStep{},
        RenderStep{},
    },
}
```

---

### Data Structure: GameContext (Shared State)

_Use a central struct to hold all shared state during a core loop pass:_

```go
type GameContext struct {
    Player   *Player
    Enemies  []*Enemy
    Events   []GameEvent
    Input    []Command
    Time     float64
    // add more systems as needed
}
```
